                    <p>Makeup moguls Jeffree Star and Kylie Jenner have been feuding for years – ever since Kylie first launched her billion-dollar beauty brand.

                    It's not so much a two-way battle as it is Jeffree continually bashing Kylie Cosmetics' most recent beauty drop, but still – it's MESSY.

                    So here's a comprehensive timeline of all the drama, shade, and glam bashing that has gone down between the two over the past three years.</p>

                    <p>MARCH 2019 — Jeffree claims Kylie only got her Forbes cover because he turned it down first.
                    Just after his brutal takedown of Jordyn Woods and Tristan Thompson's alleged affair, Jeffree Star is lowkey reviving his ongoing feud with Kylie.

                    Following Kylie's latest feature with Forbes, celebrating her spot as the youngest billionaire in the world, Dictionary.com started things off with a hefty amount of shade.</p>

                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The TEA</h2>

                    <p>They pointed out (along with everyone else, basically) that Kylie, as a reality TV star, doesn't exactly fit the definition of "self-made."

                    Jeffree gave them a RT, with a little added sass of his own. In in Tweet, he claimed that he was actually asked to do a similar feature with the brand, but turned it down.</p>

                    <p>Though, since this story is about her spot as the youngest billionaire, it's unclear how Jeffree would have been considered, since the 33-year-old launched his business in 2014.</p>


                    <p>JULY 2018 —
                    Jeffree includes Kylie Cosmetics in a shade video
                    I hope everyone had a nice, restful spring, because the drama has returned!

                    In his latest video, titled "Full Face of Brands That Hate Me," Jeffree brewed a pot of strong tea for each of his beauty nemeses: Too Faced Cosmetics, Kat Von D Beauty, and of course, Kylie Cosmetics.

                    Kylie secured multiple mentions in the video (every other brand only got one) for her "X Rated" blush and classic "Candy K" liquid lipstick.

                    On the blush, he said: "This blush was just not it for me… This just didn’t have any pigment and I’m bored." But the Lip Kit is where he really went in. </p>

                    <p> "Candy K was a very early-on color. When I tried it I wasn’t obsessed, her formula is just a little drying. I’ve liked some of the shades that she’s put out before, but overall I’m not like in love with it," he dished.

                    "I just think that there's so many [Kylie Cosmetics] products being put out and it’s not exciting anymore. It’s kind of lackluster and I’m just kind of over the brand at the moment. Maybe it will re-excite me in the future, maybe not, but right now I’m kind of like over it."

                    I wonder if she ever put him back on the press list...</p>
